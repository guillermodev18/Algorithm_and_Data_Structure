# Description 
- To get a basic understanding of this basic search algorithm.

# What I have learn
- I learn the steps of doing this type of search algorithm:
```
1. Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[].
2. If x matches with an element, return the index.
3. If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.

```
- The Linear Search Complexity is O(n).
- The best case scenario for this algorithm is when the value is in the first element in the list or near to it, but is the list have a lot of elements the running time increase.
